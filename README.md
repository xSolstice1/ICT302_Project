# ICT302 Project - Curriculum Info Application

The project aims to develop an intuitive and user-friendly application that empowers end users, who may not have a technical background, to efficiently combine, filter, group, and manipulate data from CourseLoop reports and other common sources. The application simplifies the data consolidation process, eliminating the need for advanced Excel or Power Query skills. Users can easily create a unified dataset for their specific needs.

Overall, this application serves as a user-friendly bridge between non-technical end users and complex data manipulation tasks, enabling them to efficiently work with curriculum information and other datasets without the need for advanced software skills.

## Target Audience

**End Users:** The primary audience for the application includes non-technical end users who need to access and analyze curriculum information. These users often lack expertise in data manipulation and advanced tools but require the ability to extract insights from data.
## Key Features

**Data Integration:** The application allows end users to combine multiple CourseLoop reports and other datasets into a single unified file or table.

**Intuitive Interface:** The user interface is designed to be user-friendly making it accessible to individuals with varying levels of technical proficiency.

**Data Manipulation:** Users can apply data manipulation tasks such as filtering, grouping, and possibly other transformations, all within the application.

**Efficiency:** The application streamlines the process of creating custom datasets, saving users time and effort.

**Simplified Reporting:** Users can generate reports with ease, without requiring complex technical skills or software knowledge.

**Accessibility:** The application is accessible to users who occasionally work with data and might not have the opportunity to become proficient in data analysis tools.

**Compatibility:** The application should support various file formats, including CSV and XLSX, to accommodate different data sources.

**Empowerment:** Empowers users to extract meaningful insights and create customized reports tailored to their specific requirements.
